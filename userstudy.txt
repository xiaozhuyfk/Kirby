User Study Notes:

1. Even though it's very interesting to play with both keyboards
and mouse, but the controls are quite complicated and very confusing
sometimes.

2. The game is a little bit difficult at first, you should lower the
density of your enemies at first and increase density afterwards.

3. You should add more items like potions and other powerups.

4. Your controls aren't working well sometimes after entering the
subscreen menu.
