15-112 Term Project
Hongyu Li + hongyul + Section J

This is a side scrolling game called 'Protect Kirby',
based on the original game 'Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland'.
Detailed instructions about how to play this game will be
shown after you open the game.

You can run the game by running the file 'main.py' in the
directory 'src'.

The game required the installation of python and a python
module called 'Pygame'. You can download it from the
official website: www.pygame.org

Good luck and have fun.
